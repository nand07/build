1. Organize Your Project Directory
Start by creating a directory for your package:

python/
â”œâ”€â”€ my_package/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sum.py
|-- config.json/config.yml
|-- build.sh
|-- Makefile
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
Key Files:
__init__.py: Makes the directory a Python package. This file can be empty or contain package-level imports.

module1.py and module2.py: Contain your core functionality.

setup.py: The metadata and configuration for packaging.

README.md: Documentation for your package.

LICENSE: Your chosen license for the project.

requirements.txt: Lists dependencies.

2. Add Code to Your Package
Write Python code in your module1.py and module2.py files:

python
# sum.py
3. Create the setup.py File
This file defines metadata and configuration for your package:

4. Write a requirements.txt File
List dependencies here:
numpy
pandas
5. Build and Test Your Package
Use the following commands to build and test your package:

bash
# Build the package
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

# Install the package locally
pip install .

# Test your package
python -c "from my_package.module1 import hello_world; hello_world()"
6. Publish to PyPI
If you want to make your package publicly available:
Install twine:
bash
pip install twine
Publish your package:

bash
twine upload dist/*
7. Example Repository
This is how your repository structure might look:

my_package/
â”œâ”€â”€ my_package/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ module1.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ module2.py
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ my_package-0.1.0.tar.gz
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ my_package-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

while publishing the package it was asking me for API token, what does that mean
When you publish a Python package to a repository like PyPI (Python Package Index), it asks for an API token as a way to authenticate you as the package owner or maintainer. This token serves as a secure alternative to using your PyPI username and password, ensuring that only authorized users can upload or manage packages under your account.

What is an API Token?
Definition: An API token is a unique string of characters that acts as a secret key to grant access to specific actions, like uploading a package to PyPI.

Purpose: It enhances security by not requiring you to expose your PyPI password during the publishing process.

Scope: Each token can be restricted to specific projects or granted full access to your PyPI account.

How to Get an API Token:
Log In to PyPI:

Go to PyPI and log in to your account.

Create an API Token:

Navigate to your account settings and select "API Tokens".

Click on "Add API Token", give it a name, and specify its scope (e.g., a specific package or all packages).

Copy the Token:

PyPI will generate the token for youâ€”make sure to copy it immediately, as it won't be shown again.

How to Use the API Token:
When using twine to upload your package, you can pass the token like this:

bash
twine upload dist/* -u __token__ -p <your-token>
Replace <your-token> with the actual API token value.

__token__ is a placeholder username that tells PyPI to authenticate with the token.

Alternatively, you can save the token in your .pypirc file for convenience:

plaintext
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi

[pypi]
  repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
  username = __token__
  password = <your-token>
